# Week2: Task-2

The assignment was to test the knowledge we learned today about recursive functions and
conditional logic.

## Requirements.
  - 
   Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number, for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz” and print "FizzBuzz" for the numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
